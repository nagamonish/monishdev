He's always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needs it. Watching him adapt to any given situation was an inspiration! His ability to overcome challenges truly stands out about him!",

    comment: "While working with Monish, he exemplified his self-motivation and determination to always bring perfection to the table, no matter the project. I have never seen a person like Monish who can always bring new ideas to the table and come up with solutions by thinking out of the box. His experience with React JS and in Mobile development are very in depth and I have never enjoyed working with anyone more than Monish!"
